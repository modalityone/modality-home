== Introduction
=== What is Modality?
Modality is a free, open-source, hospitality-oriented booking system, currently in development. It will support significant event complexity, unmatched by any existing open or closed-source solution.

Modality will support:

- short and long events (evenings, days, weekends, weeks)
- one-time and recurring events
- partial and full attendance
- single and multiple venues
- multiple accommodation locations and types
- transport options (parking and shuttles)
- catering options
- multi-stage payments and discounts
- detailed statistics

Modality will be useful for:

- event-oriented organisations
- hotels



=== Why the name?
'Modality' is a fusion of two words, 'modular' and 'hospitality', a nod to both the software's design and purpose.


=== Status
Modality is in the early stages of active development, and we intend to release a functioning MVP by late-2023.

Whilst the server and data models are complete, the clients have significant work remaining before they are viewable. Currently, only the Back-Office Desktop client (described below) can be compiled and run successfully from the IDE.


=== Open-source
Modality is licensed under the link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality/blob/main/LICENSE[Apache License Version 2.0^], is completely free to use and modify, and is available on link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality[GitHub^].



== The Modality Architecture
=== Java for the Web
Modality is the first large-scale Java project to use link:https://webfx.dev[WebFX^] - a toolkit that transpiles JavaFX applications into pure JavaScript web apps for direct execution in the browser.


=== Technologies
Modality is developed using the following technologies:

The services are orchestrated by link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker^] when running Modality on development machines (instructions given later in this document).


=== Layers
Modality is divided into layers of functionality, shown below:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Layer | Repository | Java Modules

| Business Logic (top layer) | link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality[modality^] | modality-event, modality-hotel, modality-restaurant, modality-catering
| Ecommerce | link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality[modality^] | modality-ecommerce
| CRM | link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality[modality^] | modality-crm
| Base | link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality[modality^] | modality-base
| WebFX Stack | link:https://github.com/webfx-project/webfx-stack[webfx-stack^] | webfx-stack
| WebFX (bottom layer) | link:https://github.com/webfx-project/webfx[webfx^] | webfx-kit
|===

==== Business logic
The highest layer of the architecture consists of business-specific modules implementing logic for events, hotels, restaurants etc. This is a customisable layer, and developers can choose to add only the modules they need, as well as provide their own.

==== Ecommerce
The next layer down is the ecommerce layer. This provides a generic domain model for ecommerce, which models sales, accounts etc. It is the location for payment gateway integration and ecommerce-specific UIs.

==== CRM
The CRM layer provides the essential CRM features, including customer accounts, integrated mailing system etc.

==== Base
The Base layer is a fully operational implementation of the WebFX Stack layer beneath, based on the Postgres database. This layer is a pure technical solution that isn't bound to any specific domain, and so is large in application scope.

==== WebFX Stack
The WebFX Stack layer provides an opinionated framework for developing enterprise applications with WebFX. This layer is responsible for communication between client and server (using a WebSocket bus), UI routing, ORM, push notification, auth, i18n, etc. Interfaces in all cases, but not always full implementations, allowing this layer to be adapted to any kind of system.

Unlike most Java frameworks, this layer works principally on the client side, following the trend initiated by mobile apps where most of the application code has been moved to the client and can run offline.

It is designed to work with JavaFX (for example, i18n provides JavaFX bindings for use with any kind of control; and the authorisation framework automatically enables/disables and shows/hides controls depending on user access).

==== WebFX
WebFX is the foundation layer, providing a web port of JavaFX (in the webfx-kit module) that can be compiled by GWT together with your application code. It is a Java-based cross-platform solution that can be used in any domain.


=== All-Layer Aggregation
Modality ships with the `modality-all` module, which aggregates together the full set of modules across all layers, for use by developers right away.



== The Modality Apps
=== Web apps
Modality uses WebFX to transpile it's JavaFX codebase into a single-page application for direct execution in the browser. No server-side rendering, and no plugins required.


=== Mobile apps
Modality uses the link:https://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/[Gluon^] toolchain to compile the codebase into native, installable apps ready for inclusion into the Google Play and Apple App stores.


=== Desktop apps
Modality also provides desktop apps, which have exactly the same UI as the web apps generated from the same source. This is useful for developers, allowing Java code to be rapidly developed and tested via the desktop, before subsequent transpilation into JavaScript and mobile (which takes time).



== Installation
=== 1. Install Java JDK
Modality is developed entirely in the Java language, and requires at least JDK 17+. Check whether this is installed:

 java --version

If it is not installed, or is an older version, please refer to link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html[this guide^].


=== 2. Install WebFX CLI
We use the WebFX CLI to compile Modality for the web. Please follow this link:https://docs.webfx.dev/#_installing_the_webfx_cli[guide^] to install it.


=== 3. Install IntelliJ IDEA
We develop Modality using the free, community edition of link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA^], and recommend you install this if you do not already have an IDE. IntelliJ allows you to easily compile and run the Modality server and clients, for the purpose of local development and testing.

NOTE: All subsequent IDE-based examples given in this documentation will be based on IntelliJ.


=== 4. Install Docker
During development, Modality uses link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker^] for all external services, including the database and the in-memory datastore for sessions.

Please install link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop^] on your local machine if you do not have it already. If using a Mac, the easiest way is to install using `brew`. Please provide Docker with a minimum of 8GB of RAM, ideally more.

NOTE: Insufficient RAM may result in `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` errors when importing the link:https://github.com/modalityone/modality-dev-db[modality-dev-db^].


=== 5. Install Git
A git client is needed to retrieve the Modality codebase from GitHub. Check if git is installed:

 git --version

If it is not installed, you may wish to refer to link:https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/[this guide^].


=== 6. Create the Modality root

 mkdir -vp modality
 export MODALITY_ROOT=${PWD}/modality


=== 7. Clone the codebase
Git clone the Modality codebase via the terminal (or IntelliJ etc):

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT
 git clone https://github.com/modalityone/modality.git .


=== 8. Unzip the development database
The Modality codebase includes a 15Mb zip file of example data, that makes it easier for developers to navigate around the running system. Execute the following commands to unzip the database, ready for later ingestion into Postgres:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources
 unzip db-dev/V0001__modality_dev_db.sql.zip -x '__MACOSX/*' -d db/


=== 9. Prepare Docker environment variables
Environment variables store the Postgres database name, username and password. Defaults are provided in the `.env-template`. Use this template file as the basis for your Docker-based configuration, by creating an `.env` file from it. You may leave the defaults, or provide new values accordingly:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 cp .env-template .env
 source .env # make the environment variables available to the shell


=== 10. Build the Docker containers
 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose build --no-cache


=== 11. Start the containers to build the database
 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose up



== Configure Modality for Development
=== Resolve all Modality Dependencies
Open Modality in IntelliJ and wait for all dependencies to be automatically resolved:

image::resolve-dependencies-1.png[]


=== Modality Server
In order to run any of the Modality client applications, the Modality Server should first be running. The Modality Server is a link:https://vertx.io/[Vert.x^] server that proxies requests to the database and is responsible for establishing and maintaining user sessions.

The easiest way to stand up the server locally is to create an application run configuration in the IDE.

In the IntelliJ menu, click `Run -> Edit Configurations` to display the following dialog, and populate with the same details:

image::run-configuration-modality-server-1.png[]
image::run-configuration-modality-server-2.png[]

Click 'OK' to save the configuration and close the dialog.


=== Back-Office Desktop
The Back-Office Desktop client is an application used by developers of Modality, and emulates the web user interface used by administrators of the system.

Create another run configuration and populate it with the details given in the screenshot below:

image::run-configuration-modality-back-office-1.png[]

Click 'OK' to save the configuration and close the dialog.


=== Front-Office Desktop
NOTE: The Front-Office Desktop client is not yet implemented.



== Build & Run Modality on Development
The Modality clients run independently of each other, but all require the Modality Server to be running, which in turn requires Docker to be running the service containers described above. Therefore, the first two steps below are mandatory before running one or more of the Modality clients locally.


=== Docker [red]***
Ensure that Docker is running:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose up


=== Modality Server [red]***
Build and run the server by executing its run configuration:

image::run-modality-server-locally-1.png[]


=== Back-Office Desktop
Build and run the Back-Office Desktop client by executing its configuration:

image::run-modality-back-office-desktop-locally-1.png[]

The Back-Office Desktop client will then be ready to use:

image::modality-back-office-desktop-1.png[]
image::modality-back-office-desktop-2.png[]
image::modality-back-office-desktop-3.png[]
image::modality-back-office-desktop-4.png[]


=== Back-Office Web
<1> First *build* the index.html file:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT
 webfx build --gwt

<2> Then *locate* the resultant index.html file on the filesystem:

 webfx build --gwt --locate

<3> In the IntelliJ Project window, navigate to the index file and double click.

image::modality-project-window-index-html-1.png[]

<4> Hover the mouse over the index.html source code to display the browser options.

image::modality-project-window-index-html-2.png[]

<5> Click on one of the browser icons to run the index.html in a browser.


=== Back-Office Mobile
Full instructions (and limitations) for compiling the codebase to native Android and iOS apps are available on the WebFX documentation site link:https://docs.webfx.dev/#_android_platform[here].


=== Front-Office Desktop
NOTE: The Front-Office Desktop client is not yet implemented.


=== Front-Office Web
NOTE: The Front-Office Web client is not yet implemented.


=== Front-Office Mobile
NOTE: The Front-Office Mobile client is not yet implemented.



== Modality Database
All database setup scripts are stored in the `$MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources/db-pristine/` folder, and are numbered in order of execution. They should be copied into the `$MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources/db/` deployment folder where they will then be executed by the Flyway container, which runs on Docker startup. All the data will then be stored on the host, in directory:

 $MODALITY_ROOT/docker/data/postgres/*

This provides persistence, and the container can be safely shut down and restarted without losing data.

Any new database scripts must be:

<1> added to the `$MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources/db-pristine/` folder
<2> named according to the convention used in the folder: `V{latest-number+1}__{desc}.sql`
<3> copied into the `$MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources/db/` deployment folder
<4> executed by Flyway by restarting Docker:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/modality-base/modality-base-server-datasource/src/main/resources/
 .
 # Create the new SQL file and copy to the deployment directory
 touch db-pristine/V0100__new_table.sql
 cp db-pristine/V0100__new_table.sql db/V0100__new_table.sql
 .
 # Now restart Docker
 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose down
 docker-compose up



== Modality Session
The session data is controlled by the docker-based Redis container and is not persisted locally. The data persists only as long as the container is running.



== Using Docker
=== Connect to the Docker database container
Connection is easily made via any Postgres client (e.g. DBeaver). Use the following credentials (contained within the `docker/.env-template` file):

* Server: 127.0.0.1
* Port: 5432
* Database: modality
* User: modality
* Password: modality


=== Connect to the Docker session container
Connection can be made through the Docker terminal:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker exec -ti session /bin/sh
 redis-cli
 keys *


=== Shut down Docker

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose down


=== Prune Docker content [[prune_docker_content]]
Sometimes you will want a pristine Docker environment. The simplest way to do this is:

 cd $MODALITY_ROOT/docker
 docker-compose down
 docker ps -a # Lists all Docker containers
 docker rm <container-id> # Remove any docker containers listed
 docker images # Lists all Docker images
 docker image rm <image-id> # Remove any docker images listed
 docker volume ls # Lists all Docker volumes
 docker volume rm <volume-id> # Remove all docker volumes listed
 docker system prune # Removes build cache, networks and dangling images
 rm -rf data # Removes locally stored database tables

You can now rebuild the Docker containers:

 docker-compose build --no-cache
 docker-compose up



== Deploy Modality to Heroku
NOTE: Procedures for this coming soon!
